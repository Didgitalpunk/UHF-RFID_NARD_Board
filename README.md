# UHF-RFID_NARD_Board
A PCB for connecting UHF-RFID readers to your flipper, and part of a NARD board to interface with a SAM.
Also has a 10 pin ICSP header and SPI header to use with various FAPs.

This board is made for the flipper zero and uses https://github.com/frux-c/uhf_rfid for the UHF-RFID part, and https://github.com/bettse/seader for the NARD part.
The SPI and ICSP headers on this board are here for use with the SPI_Mem_Manager fap, and the AVR_Flasher fap respectively, among I'm sure others faps.

Thanks to the UHF|RFID gang over on the flipper zero discord for all the nice comments, all the info, and especially, the initial push on the UHF|RFID project!
